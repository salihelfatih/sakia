## Scope of Contributions

This repository powers the Sakia Labs website and is maintained intentionally.

We are most open to:
- Bug fixes

- Small, well-scoped refinements

If you’re interested in Sakia Labs’ broader work, some projects are developed in the open:
https://github.com/orgs/sakialabs/repositories

Large features or structural changes should be discussed before any work begins.

## Standards

We care deeply about the quality of what we ship.

Contributions should:
- Be focused and intentional
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Include tests when behavior changes
- Keep the codebase easy to understand and maintain

If a change adds complexity, it should clearly justify why.

---

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository and create a focused branch  
2. Make your changes with care  
3. Ensure tests and linting pass  
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of what changed and why  

Please keep pull requests small and scoped to a single concern where possible.

## Communication

If you’re unsure whether a change makes sense:
- Open an issue first
- Or reach out via email at **sakia.labs@hey.com**

We aim to respond thoughtfully, even if not immediately.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and considerate in all interactions.

We expect the same care in communication as we do in code.
